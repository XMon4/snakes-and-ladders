# snakes-and-ladders
My first c++ project, based on classic board game snakes and ladders

This is a code that simply emulates a game board, and takes turns rolling a dice for each player involved, based on how many were selected (1-4).
As the name implies, there is a chance for each player to stumble across a board tile that triggers a ladder, which takes you up several tiles, or a snake, which drops you down several tiles.
No additional input is needed after selecting number of players, as the game's mechanics are that simple by nature, and so the program will only pause and wait for any button after each action, to allow time to see the changes.
